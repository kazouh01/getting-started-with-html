Key Learnings<br>
<p><b>The Web and Webpages</b></p>

The <b>World Wide Web</b> was invented in the 1990's and is a collection of HTML documents.  The contents of the web are accessed using browsers like explorer or firefox  to connect with the internent which in turn connects with servers
that contain the requested information. Anything can exist on the web. <br>
A <b>webpage</b> is a document on the World Wide Web, consisting of an 
HTML file and other related files and graphics.  
Webpages can also have hyperlinkes to other documents on the Web.   
<br>
<b>HTML</b> <em>(HyperText Markup Language)</em> is the main type of document on the web and connectes everything on the web.
HTML allows you to see what you see on the web and formats what it looks like as well as containing references to other documents, images or videos through links.<br>
<p><b>Coding, Tags and Elements</b></p>
<b>Coding</b> is when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  When written properly, the computer can follow the instructions.  
Computers can only do exactly what the programmers tell it to do and cannot figure out what the programmer meant to do, so it is essential that programs are written correctly.<br><b>Tags</b>
are always written in angled brackets like these <  >. In most instances there must be an opening and a closing tag, in order for the computer
to know when to start and stop a particular action, if the closing tag is missing the computer will carry out the same instructions
to everything after the opening tag (i.e. bold, italics).  There are some tags that do not require a closing tag and they are called 
"void" tags - like the tag for a line break.  Tags are also defined as <b>inline</b><em>(ends a line)</em> or <b>block</b><em>(makes a box - can have height and width)</em>.<br>
<b>Elements</b> are everything within a set of openining and closing tags.<br>
<p> You can also add hyperlinks in your documents by defining attributes in your HTML elements for example if you click on the word <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> in this sentence you will automatically be taken to the Udacity website, where I am learning all this cool stuff.</p>
<p><b>Images</b></p>
While images add the extra touch to any webpage, it is very important that when you add the image link to your document
you must also add a link to an alternate text that will display if for some reason your image does not show up, this will
advise your readers if there are any issues or explain the missing image.<br>
